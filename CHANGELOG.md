## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Standalone Python package for the tested Securedact MCP adapter and local
  provider-independent privacy engine.
- Four MCP tools: `analyze_text`, `redact_text`, `restore_text`, and
  `create_safe_copy`.
- Python 3.12 metadata and `securedact-mcp` console entry point.
- Versioned synthetic privacy corpus and unit/integration coverage.
- Product, security, privacy, threat-model, client, testing, and release docs.
- Repository validation, CI, release workflow, and community health files.
- Guided `securedact-mcp install` setup for English, Dutch, both, or no
  contextual model, with explicit interactive/non-interactive consent.
- Versioned model registry pinning the official `flair/ner-english-large` and
  `flair/ner-dutch-large` repositories to immutable commits and exact checkpoint
  metadata.
- Direct official downloads through `huggingface_hub`, managed OS data paths,
  component-level SHA-256 manifests, isolated offline Flair load tests, and
  atomic activation.
- `securedact-mcp models` list, status, verify, diagnose, path, update, repair,
  and remove commands.
- Pinned `FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-large` tokenizer/configuration runtime assets
  required by both serialized Flair checkpoints, stored in a shared managed
  Hugging Face cache rather than an ambient user cache.
- Local conservative English/Dutch runtime routing and an optional Windows
  bootstrap installer.
- Safe `securedact-mcp models diagnose` output for managed configuration,
  integrity, detector readiness, and final failure-code inspection.
- `securedact-mcp diagnostics runtime` for sanitized protocol, deterministic,
  per-language contextual, and full-engine readiness.
- A versioned Dutch MCP person/email regression fixture, 75+ positive and 50+
  negative email cases, bounded property tests, and a real stdio cold-start test.

### Security

- Explicit MCP host-invocation limitation and approved-output workflow.
- Safe-copy basename, extension, configured-root, and no-overwrite controls.
- Input-size limit and fail-closed required-model behavior.
- Local models, mappings, safe copies, logs, credentials, and build artifacts
  excluded from version control and release artifacts.
- Consent, allowlisted-source, immutable-revision, integrity, staging, rollback,
  fail-closed runtime, and no-model-artifact release gates.
- Managed multilingual startup now loads each enabled Flair detector exactly
  once, reports ready only when all children are ready, and returns a stable
  non-sensitive failure code when any enabled model fails to load.
- Managed model configuration now takes precedence over inherited legacy model
  variables, and CLI/runtime discovery shares one model-store resolver and
  active-configuration loader.
- Setup, verification, diagnostics, and MCP startup now share one offline cache
  environment. Fresh-process verification prevents unrelated global caches from
  making an incomplete installation appear ready.
- MCP initialize and `tools/list` no longer wait for Flair deserialization.
  Enabled models load once after the standard initialized notification; calls
  during loading fail closed with `contextual_model_initializing` and are not
  queued or replayed.
- The production engine now enforces its deterministic regex and contextual-rule
  layers before reporting ready. Missing layers return
  `privacy_detector_stack_incomplete`.
- Fixed the email terminal-boundary rule that rejected canonical addresses before
  sentence punctuation such as `emma@example.com.`. The practical detector now
  rejects malformed/URL suffixes without returning partial email spans.
